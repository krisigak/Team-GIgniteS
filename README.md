# Hot Spotted: Increase Your Awareness Surrounding Fire Risk and Report Any New Fire Events

Team GIgniteS: Amy Hopman, Stuart Jones, Krisiga Krishnarajah

#### Our Mission Statement

Alberta is home to approximately 800 conservation sites enjoyed by the public daily. However, these landmarks have faced an increased risk in recent years due to the warming climate and its adverse effects on the area's disturbance ecology and fire regimes. For example, over a 13-year period between 2006 - 2018, Alberta experienced 19,844 unique wildfire events, any of which could have threatened to burn through these conservation areas.  

Since the 1970s, Alberta’s boreal forest has been experiencing warmer and drier conditions. As a result of the warming climate, this area has seen a significant increase in both the frequency and severity of wildland fire events (Whitman et al., 2022). This is problematic because wildfires have many negative environmental impacts on the local area such as destroying the natural habitats of native species, contributing to carbon emissions, and depleting the forest’s ability to act as a carbon sink. Therefore, it is imperative that wildfires are addressed proactively to protect the existing forest stands and native biodiversity in Alberta.

As such, our app will help mitigate the threat of wildfire destruction by educating the user about safe fire-keeping habits and increasing awareness of the fire risk imposed on communities in Alberta. Furthermore, because wildfires are an ever-present threat, in the event that a user finds themself at risk of wildfire exposure, this app gives them the necessary tools to promptly report such a wildfire event so that it can be dealt with swiftly, before spreading out of control. This app aims to not only proactively preserve Alberta’s conservation sites by increasing wildfire awareness but to also serve as a tool to help users assess and update the historical fire danger conditions throughout the province.

We have created a StoryMap Collection called Hot Spotted, to help citizens of Alberta prevent and prepare for wildfires.


#### App and Experience Builder Descriptions and Features:

##### Hot Spotted Web App:

This web app displays a map showing where wildfires have occurred in Alberta between the years 2006 and 2018. With increasing concerns surrounding climate change, fire regimes have been moving towards patterns of higher frequencies and severities, and this is only going to get worse. This web app includes 4 widgets for the user to explore past wildfire events and report new ones across the province of Alberta.

###### ***Smart Editor Feature:*** 

This smart editor feature allows for the editing of current features as well as the addition of new features. If you see a wildfire and are able to report information regarding the fire type, size, and cause (other information is available to be filled out, but is not required), you can add it and it will update the wildfire layer for everyone to see.

###### ***Filter Feature:***
The filter feature can be used to filter for years, causes, and fire types that the user may be interested in.

###### ***Bookmark Feature:***
This feature allows the user to add bookmarks to keep track of their own additions to the web app and save areas of interest.

###### ***Share Feature:***
The share feature can be used to share any analysis, results, or maps the user has produced through a variety of social media platforms, as well as, URLs.

##### Alberta’s Wildland-Urban Interface Experience Builder:

This experience builder allows the user to learn more about the wildland-urban interface (WUI) in Alberta. The builder displays a map that shows the population density of Alberta’s Census subdivisions along with communities along the WUI, which are moderate-highly densely populated, further contributing to ignition-related human activities.

###### ***Bookmark Feature:***
Navigating through the bookmarks, the user will be able to view wildfire hot spots, indicated by green pins. These hot spots were found to have statistically significant high occurrences of anthropogenic wildfires. 

###### ***Button Feature:***
The buttons allow the user to view other components of the ‘Hot Spotted’ project within the collection.

#### Statement of Characteristics:

Two apps were developed for the “Hot Spotted” project. First, **the Hot Spotted App** displays a
map showing where wildfires have occurred in Alberta between the years 2006 and 2018. With
increasing concerns surrounding climate change, fire regimes have been moving towards patterns of
higher frequencies and severities, and this is only going to get worse. This web app includes 4 widgets
for the user to explore past wildfire events and report new ones across the province of Alberta. 
This smart editor feature allows for the editing of current features as well as the addition of new
features. This means that if the user comes across a wildfire, they are able to report information
regarding the fire type, size, and cause (other information is available to be filled out, but is not
required). Once the user reports the wildfire, the app will update the wildfire layer for everyone to see,
thereby ensuring that both users and the province have up-to-date wildfire data and can respond
accordingly. The Hot Spotted app also comes with a filter feature that can be used to examine
Alberta’s modern wildfires using criteria such as the fire’s years, cause, and type. This is useful since it
increases clarity since the user now has the ability to efficiently display only the data they are
interested in, rather than having to manually navigate through a clutter of points. Furthermore, the
bookmark feature allows the user to add bookmarks to keep track of their own additions to the web
app and save areas of interest, again further making this app a useful education tool along with its
ability to report. Lastly, Hot Spotted also includes a share feature that can be used to share any
analysis, results, or maps the user has produced through a variety of social media platforms, as well
as URLs. This tool can be used to both notify fellow Albertans about an active wildfire the user just
reported, or for personal research that could result in valuable insights being made toward further
understanding the trends in Alberta’s fire regime.

Secondly, for the **Alberta Wildland Urban Interface Experience Builder**, this app allows the user
to learn more about the wildland-urban interface (WUI) in Alberta. The builder displays a map that
shows the population density of Alberta’s Census subdivisions along with communities along the WUI,
which are moderate-highly densely populated, further contributing to ignition-related human activities.
For ease of use, a bookmark feature was included to help the user swiftly navigate to the various
wildfire hotspots in Alberta (indicated by green pins for further clarity). These hot spots were found to
have statistically significant high occurrences of anthropogenic wildfires, hence why drawing the user’s
attention to them is helpful since it lets them quickly observe the most significant data. Furthermore,
because Hot Spotted aims to educate the user on both the proactive and reactive forms of wildfire
safety, the Alberta WUI app uses button features to direct the user to the other components of the ‘Hot
Spotted’ project depending on what aspect of Alberta wildfires they are interested in, letting them
efficiently navigate the Hot Spotted StoryMap collection.
